# Javascript
Hi I used to update my Javascript content which I usually do practice during my learning.Also help me in way to revise the concept before upstepping for the project in which Javascript is usually used.

In this branch I have done study over the DOM in JavaScript. DOM --> Document Object Manipulation this concept for me not just because of just gathering knowladge about the topics it include but also that how should I need work over the Javascript in terms of HTML and CSS also.
Being a learner of FRONTEND it is important for me to focus over the topics like DOM.
